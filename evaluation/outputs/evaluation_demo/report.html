        <p>Checked 7 claims:</p>

        <div class="fact-check verdict-insufficient">
            <strong>Claim 1:</strong> Shopify, Slack, Snapchat, Squarespace, Tesla, The New York Times, Typeform, Twitter, Uber, Udemy, Wh...<br>
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> insufficient (confidence: 0.30)<br>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> Source 1 mentions Shopify and Slack using JavaScript frameworks.  However, the claim includes many other companies whose use of JavaScript frameworks is not mentioned in any of the provided sources. Source 2 is irrelevant, and Source 3 only discusses companies using Shopify, not whether they use JavaScript frameworks.
        </div>

        <div class="fact-check verdict-supported">
            <strong>Claim 2:</strong> There are multiple excellent JavaScript frameworks available for web application development....<br>
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> supported (confidence: 0.80)<br>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> Sources 1, 2, and 3 all list multiple JavaScript frameworks suitable for web application development.  Source 1 explicitly mentions React, Angular, and Vue.js as excellent options, while Source 2 and 3 list several more, highlighting their popularity and suitability. While none explicitly use the word 'excellent', the context of the articles (listing them as 'best' or 'top') strongly implies a positive assessment of their quality.
        </div>

        <div class="fact-check verdict-contradicted">
            <strong>Claim 3:</strong> Laravel is a JavaScript framework....<br>
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> contradicted (confidence: 0.95)<br>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> Sources 1 and 2 explicitly state that Laravel is a back-end framework written in PHP, not JavaScript.  Source 1 highlights the difference between JavaScript (client-side) and Laravel (server-side). Source 2 emphasizes Laravel's independence from JavaScript frameworks.  Therefore, the claim that Laravel is a JavaScript framework is clearly contradicted.
        </div>

        <div class="fact-check verdict-supported">
            <strong>Claim 4:</strong> Vue.js has fewer third-party libraries and tools compared to React and Angular....<br>
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> supported (confidence: 0.80)<br>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> Source 1 explicitly states that Vue.js has a smaller ecosystem and limited support and third-party libraries compared to Angular and React.  Source 2, while focusing on job market demand, implicitly supports the claim by mentioning React's 'popular ecosystem,' suggesting Vue's is less so. Source 3 is not directly relevant to the claim about the number of third-party libraries.
        </div>

        <div class="fact-check verdict-insufficient">
            <strong>Claim 5:</strong> Inertia.js is useful for building reusable and maintainable components in Laravel....<br>
            <strong>Verdict:</strong> insufficient (confidence: 0.30)<br>
            <strong>Rationale:</strong> No clear supporting evidence found
